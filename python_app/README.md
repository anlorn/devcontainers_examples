This Python app serves as an example of using DevContainers. It uses poetry for dependency management. While poetry might not offer significant advantages for microservices when DevContainers are already in useâ€”since microservices typically have a well-defined CI/CD pipeline and don't need to be deployed in various environments like desktop apps. I used poetry here because my team already uses poetry for our Python services. Example how to use poetry with devcotnainers allowed us to continue leveraging our existing setup without needing to remove poetry when migrating to DevContainers, enabling us to deliver value incrementally.
